                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from

                        <li><strong>DIMENSIONS.</strong> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within 
                            a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be 
                            adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.</li>
                        <li><strong>COMPETITION FIELDS.</strong>Fields used within the competition program must be 
                            a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in 
                            the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these 
                            minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will 
                            assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board 
                            whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams 
                            from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable 
                            field may be required to play all their games away.</li>
